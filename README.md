# Rooftop Greenhouse Design Project 

This project was completed as part of the first-year design course at the University of Toronto for a real client: Prof. Hamid Timorabadi. The objective was to design a cost-effective, regulation-compliant greenhouse structure to be installed on a residential townhouse rooftop.

## Project Overview

- Lean-to style greenhouse with south/east-facing windows and sliding door
- Materials selected for durability, insulation, and light transmittance
- Considered real-world environmental factors (wind, snow, urban regulations)

## My Contribution

- Conducted stakeholder/environmental analysis
- Defined structural functions and constraints
- Supported cost estimation and compliance with Ontario Building Code

## Tools & Skills

- Design & Analysis: solar energy capture
- Compliance: Ontario Building Code, urban wind/snow constraints
- Communication: Client interview, stakeholder analysis
