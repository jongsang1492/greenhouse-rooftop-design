Client-based rooftop greenhouse design project for Prof. Timorabadi (University of Toronto 1st year design course)

# Rooftop Greenhouse Design Project 🌱🏡

This project was completed as part of the first-year design course at the University of Toronto for a real client: Prof. Hamid Timorabadi. The objective was to design a cost-effective, regulation-compliant greenhouse structure to be installed on a residential townhouse rooftop.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Lean-to style greenhouse with south/east-facing windows and sliding door
- Materials selected for durability, insulation, and light transmittance
- Considered real-world environmental factors (wind, snow, urban regulations)

## 👷 My Contribution
